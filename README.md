<p>Night's Conversion allows you to use the properties of every sword that went into the Night's Edge. When using Night's Conversion, you can craft 3 new swords, each of which have some relation to one of the swords that went into the Night's Edge. The regular Night's Edge is assumed to be the Light's Bane version for this mod.</p>
